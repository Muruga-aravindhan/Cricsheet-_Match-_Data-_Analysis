#Cricsheet Match Data Analysis Project
#Project Overview
This project analyzes cricket match data from Cricsheet using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The aim is to extract, preprocess, analyze, and visualize match data for various formats (ODI, Test, T20) to uncover performance insights about players and teams.

#Problem Statement
Process cricket match data in JSON format from Cricsheet.

Transform raw data into structured SQL tables.

Perform statistical and performance analysis using SQL.

Visualize insights using Python EDA and Power BI dashboard.

#Technologies Used
Python – JSON parsing, data cleaning, EDA (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)

Pandas – DataFrame manipulation

#SQL (MySQL) – Database creation and analytical queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboards

Cricsheet JSON Data – Source of match data (ODI, T20, Test)
